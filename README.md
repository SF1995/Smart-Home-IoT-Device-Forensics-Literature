# Smart-Home-IoT-Device-Forensics-Literature
Collection of current literature regarding the topic of smart home IoT device forensics. The 35 found papers can be put into three main categories, the first one being device forensics research related to Smart Speakers & Voice Assistants, with 10 results. Wearables, a classification that includes mainly devices like fitness trackers and
smart watches, are the second category with 13 identified papers, while the Smart Things category with 12 publications includes devices making a house smart (e.g., lights, vacuum robot, cameras, and other sensors), and are not limited to one specific kind of device.

A Crime Scene Layout is a visual documentation of the scene of a crime as it appeared at the time of its discovery. It usually includes a floor plan of the area, the location of the victim(s), blood spatter, possible items of interest such as weapons, footprints, dirt, clothing, as well as written details and pictorial evidence. A properly prepared crime scene diagram is very useful for investigative and forensic work in the criminal justice system. Not only for traditional forensics this is relevant but also for conduction DF in a smart home environment. This means, that in addition to traditional forensic evidence, PDE sources can be mapped in a crime scene layout and provide an informative overview on sources and ease the work with evidence without losing sight of the bigger picture.
