The following section presents a prototypical implementation of the model to demonstrate the practical usage of the theoretical model. Furthermore, publicly available information about the Target Corp. Data Breach is used for a small case study to determine the maturity level of the organization at the time of the breach.

5.1 Implementation
The previously proposed model for determining a company’s digital forensic readiness maturity level is based on querying indicators to determine the capability levels. This mechanism was implemented as a web-based application. The indicators shown in the Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Appendix A have been translated into questions and stored in a MySQL database. The logic to determine the capability level and the maturity level was implemented with JavaScript. If a company undergoes such an assessment, a skilled professional can evaluate the indicators, grouped by COBIT 5 enablers, according to the current situation. As soon as sufficient questions for the determination of the maturity level have been answered, the tool presents the result. The result consists of the capability levels of the company per enabler, the level of maturity achieved and a list with the answered indicators. With these results, specific areas of the company can be developed to achieve the DFR objectives.

5.2 Evaluation of the model
The applicability of the model is tested by using information about the Target Corp. Data Breach as a baseline for a case study. In November and December 2013, the company suffered a until then unique security breach. Attackers penetrated the company’s network via a third party vendor and compromised point of sale devices with malware. This made it possible for the attacker to collect 40 million card numbers and 70 million personal entries. This data was afterwards offered for sale on the black market.

This case was chosen because it occurred despite enormous previously established IT security measures. The case has been under investigation for several years and faces significant barriers to capture the cybercriminals. Subsequently, the seven enablers are examined according to the implemented measures for DFR before the incident. Further the level of capability of the respective enabler is determined and finally the level of maturity is derived.

DFR Maturity levels
Enabler: Principles, Policies and Frameworks
Enabler: Processes
Enabler: Organizational structures
Enabler: Information
Enabler: Culture, ethics and behavior
Enabler: People, skills and competencies
Enabler: Services, infrastructure and applications

Enabler principles, policies and frameworks The employed Chief Information Officer before the incident had no background in computer science. Management also decided not to follow warnings and advices of a recently installed IT security tool and decided not to re-evaluate the systems. In addition, advices from security experts to the management were ignored. The fact that after the incident the position as Chief Information Officer was filled with a candidate with the appropriate experience also shows that there was no knowledge present about the correct procedure in case of an incident. The analysis of the case shows that the Target Corp. was repeatedly warned about the incident by the protection systems and that the employees did not initiate the correct actions.

This analysis allows to conclude that besides the management’s lack of understanding of IT security measures, the establishment of suitable principles, policies and frameworks according DF measures was not fully established and therefore no regulations for DFR were implemented.
