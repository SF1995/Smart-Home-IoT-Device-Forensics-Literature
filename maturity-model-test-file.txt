The following section presents a prototypical implemen-
tation of the model to demonstrate the practical usage of
the theoretical model. Furthermore, publicly available
information about the Target Corp. Data Breach [32]is
used for a small case study to determine the maturity level
of the organization at the time of the breach.
5.1 Implementation
The previously proposed model for determining a com-
pany’s digital forensic readiness maturity level is based on
querying indicators to determine the capability levels. This
mechanism was implemented as a web-based application.1
The indicators shown in the Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in
Appendix A have been translated into questions and stored
in a MySQL database. The logic to determine the capa-
bility level and the maturity level was implemented with
JavaScript. If a company undergoes such an assessment, a
skilled professional can evaluate the indicators, grouped by
COBIT 5 enablers, according to the current situation. As
soon as sufﬁcient questions for the determination of the
maturity level have been answered, the tool presents the

assessment tool is available upon request).

result. The result consists of the capability levels of the
company per enabler, the level of maturity achieved and a
list with the answered indicators. With these results,
speciﬁc areas of the company can be developed to achieve
the DFR objectives.
5.2 Evaluation of the model
The applicability of the model is tested by using informa-
tion about the Target Corp. Data Breach [32] as a baseline
for a case study. In November and December 2013, the
company suffered a until then unique security breach.
Attackers penetrated the company’s network via a third
party vendor and compromised point of sale devices with
malware. This made it possible for the attacker to collect
40 million card numbers and 70 million personal entries.
This data was afterwards offered for sale on the black
market.
This case was chosen because it occurred despite enor-
mous previously established IT security measures. The
case has been under investigation for several years and
faces signiﬁcant barriers to capture the cybercriminals [32].
Subsequently, the seven enablers are examined accord-
ing to the implemented measures for DFR before the
incident. Further the level of capability of the respective
enabler is determined and ﬁnally the level of maturity is
derived.

Enabler principles, policies and frameworks The
employed Chief Information Ofﬁcer before the incident
had no background in computer science. Management also
decided not to follow warnings and advices of a recently
installed IT security tool and decided not to re-evaluate the
systems. In addition, advices from security experts to the
management were ignored. The fact that after the incident
the position as Chief Information Ofﬁcer was ﬁlled with a
candidate with the appropriate experience also shows that
there was no knowledge present about the correct proce-
dure in case of an incident. [33] The analysis of the case
shows that the Target Corp. was repeatedly warned about
the incident by the protection systems and that the
employees did not initiate the correct actions [23].
This analysis allows to conclude that besides the man-
agement’s lack of understanding of IT security measures,
the establishment of suitable principles, policies and
frameworks according DF measures was not fully estab-
lished and therefore no regulations for DFR were
implemented.
Enabler processes It can be assumed that the company
has a good understanding of its business processes, since a
crucial security function of the point of sale devices had
just been deactivated in order to not slow down the check
out process of the customer [33]. Target Corp. had
implemented good IT security measures, but the handling
of messages from the systems was not correct among the
employees due to inadequate training [32]. As a result, the
knowledge of a correct procedure in case of an incident
could not be implemented.
Enabler organizational structures After the breach a
new CIO was announced and a 100 million dollar plan for
enhancing their security has been promoted. Therein the
enhancement of security of various accounts as well as
reviewing and limiting vendor access has been addresses.
Especially the insufﬁcient implementation of access con-
trol by different groups and third party partners made the
attack feasible [32]. This allows the conclusion that central
elements of the organizational structure were insufﬁciently
developed.
Enabler information It is not clear whether sufﬁcient
internal information about the handling of digital evidence
was available. However, it is well known that major
investments were made in IT security tools and measures.
These included the network security system named Fire-
Eye, which includes a Network Intrusion Detection System
(NIDS) [32]. These tools usually also include possibilities
to obtain evidence for a forensic investigation. Since dif-
ferent prevention functionalities were deactivated due to
lack of knowledge of the administrators [32] it is assumed
that further possibilities of the system were also not or
insufﬁciently known among relevant stakeholder.
Enabler culture, ethics and behavior Little is known
about the culture, ethics and behavior before the incident. It
is assumed that the data breach was not performed or ini-
tiated by an insider [32]. However, employee awareness of
IT security incidents was partially suppressed for business-
enhancing convenience [23].
Therefore, for the use case presented here, it is assumed
that a fraud intolerant culture exists in the company and
that the employees do not hinder an investigation. How-
ever, in some cases this is overshadowed by measures that
threaten IT security for the purpose of promoting direct
business goals.
Enabler people, skills and competences It can be seen
that before the attack, management had already been
informed about IT security weaknesses but did not follow
the recommendations of experts [33].
The lack of knowledge about the consequences of dis-
abling important security warnings in intrusion detection
systems combined with the result that employees still do
not follow the procedure of the system is critical. This
shows that the employees have been insufﬁciently trained
[23]. It is assumed that in this use case not only the
teaching of relevant IT security skills and competences but
also the DF trainings have failed.
Enabler services, infrastructure and applications The
Target Corp. had extensive ambitions to keep the IT
security in the company up-to-date and running. Before the
data breach, for example, a malware detection tool was
implemented in the company for 1.6 USD. In addition,
extensive evaluations of the existing IT security measures
were regularly undertaken. [23]
In summary, Target has taken extensive measures to
increase IT security and has even deployed a network
intrusion system. As mentioned before, these tools also
have the ability to acquire usable evidence. For this use
case the expected capability level in the area of services,
infrastructure and applications is therefore deﬁned as
managed.
The following Table 3 presents the speciﬁc levels of
capability of the seven enablers and provides the basis for
determining the level of maturity of the entire company
with regard to DFR.
Based on the previously determined levels of capability
of the seven enablers in Table 3, the maturity level ‘‘1—
Initial’’ for DFR can be determined for the Target Corp. at
the time of the attack in November 2013. This maturity
level implies that not all measures to meet the DFR
objectives are in place within the organization. The use

case shows that an insufﬁcient understanding of DFR by
the management also has a negative impact on all areas
throughout the company. The insufﬁcient degree of matu-
rity in the presented case study also supports the thesis that
till now the criminals behind the cyber attack could not be
prosecuted due to insufﬁcient evidence. In addition, the
investigation has already cost an enormous amount of time
and money. This could have been mitigated by a company-
wide implementation of DFR measures before the incident.
6 Conclusion and future work
A signiﬁcant role of digital forensic activities was endorsed
due to the increasing amount of threats to the information
systems of organizations. If an incident occurs and all
Information Security measures fail, a digital forensic
investigation needs to be conducted.
The main goal of this paper is to develop a DFR speciﬁc
CMM and to show, how its application can assist in
implement DFR capability within an organization. There-
fore, signiﬁcant characteristics of being digital forensic
ready have been used.
Due to a study of similar capability maturity models it
was possible to determine the third level as an accept-
able state to consider an organization as digital forensic
ready. A concrete suggestion of a DFR speciﬁc model has
been provided and reﬂected with the support of IT-
Governance aspects and instruments. In addition, the pro-
posed model was applied to an adapted use case and a
maturity level of a speciﬁc organization was determined.
This work demonstrates the advantage by combining IT-
Governance aspects with a capability maturity model. A
majority of managers and decision makers know IT-
Governance frameworks and may be familiar with their
use. A broadly accepted, management oriented framework
can be used to implement the necessary measures to reach
digital forensic readiness within an organization. Decision
makers gain a deeper understanding on what directions the
organization needs to focus on. This approach also mini-
mizes the risk of wrong investments and to put efforts into
a wrong direction. A capability maturity model assists in
this context as a compass navigation to the right direction.
It is also a useful tool to determine the current state of
ongoing implementation at any time. Due to the fact that
some DFR initiatives need further assistance by the higher
management, the combination of IT-Governance with the
DFR initiatives gains further support. Nevertheless, the
application of the DFR speciﬁc CMM needs to be evalu-
ated in a real-world scenario with additional expert inter-
views and is part of future work.
The development and application of a capability matu-
rity model is not a single incentive to assess the maturity
level or to improve it. Moreover, the intention of imple-
menting such a model is to establish continuous improve-
ments in speciﬁc areas. The use of different types of
indicators (mandatory or optional) also shows the tempo-
rary character of the capability assessment which is per-
formed on a ﬁxed moment. By rising threats and emerging
technologies the measures and structures, previously
assigned for the fulﬁllment of a capability level, could be
outdated. This requires a modiﬁcation and adjustment of
the needed measures to reach a speciﬁc capability level.
However, assistance is provided by pointing out sig-
niﬁcant measures, needed to fulﬁll a desired level. This
makes the model useful in practice. Also the continuous
assessment and improving by using the capability maturity
model can be supported.
